session: Management

root: ~/.bookmarks/kbn

# Wasn't working in scripts
# env:
#   MANAGEMENT_PIDS_FILE: /tmp/management.pid

# To not overlap with different uair instances
# --socket /run/user/1000/uair-management.sock
# Will need to add this socket to the uairctl too.

# FIX: Doesn't execute on session destroy.Works only on `smug stop
# Management`. 
# TODO: Seems by design. If I want to make it work from anywhere,
# I may need to add `stop` command in tmux kill command. Also
# see next issue because it's related.
# FIX: Moreover, doesn't see env when stopped not from Management
# session.
# TODO: It doesn't see env because it's encapsulated into this shell
# (session). To fix it, we can make a separate file with envs and source it
# directly in start and stop script.
